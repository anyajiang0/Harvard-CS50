Functions â†’ verbs or actions that the computer can perform. 
For example, the print function takes the argument, "Hello, world," and prints it.

print("Hello, world")

Input is anotehr function that takes a prompt as an argument.

Variables are a container for values in the program.

In-line comments can be used as a to-do list to help the person accomplish the coding task.
This is called psuedocode.

strings, known as 'str', are sequences of text. 

The print function automatically includes the argument end='\n'. The '\n'
indicaes that the print function will automatically create a line break when run. 

However, you can provide an argument for 'end' such that a new line is not created.

print(name)

"""
The most elegant way to use strings would be f strings. 

The f is a special indicator for python to treat the string a special way. F strings will be 
used quite frequently while taking cs50.

By using the strip method on a variable (for example, name = name.strip()),  any whitespace 
from the left and right of the user's input will be removed. 

By using the title method, the user's name will be title-cased. You can use multiple methods 
on a variable.

An integer is referred to as an int.
"""

However, the input is interpreted as a string. We will need to convert the sting into an integer.
